use github and tgp/json files for metadata management!!!
builders can run in a local repository to see preview

##builder types
builders
  inteligent - use github
  build metadata, benchmark, discussion
  add products preferable with crawler from other eCommerce or make sites
  graphics designers - icons for features

users
  fill preferences (as category sort) and choices (as normal usages)
  fill issues (form based)
  run benchmarks and fill results
  run crawlers and gain $cCoin by downloading p2p software

##external references
$ref: url[]
any data and metadata needs external references (can be to wikipedia, web page url or screenshot url).
E.g. a feature defintion will ref to an eCommerce sites using the name and picklist values.

##discussion page
$discussion: url[]
github text file discussion about anything. e.g. discussion/iphoneX-weight.
any json inner object can have a reference to discussion page

##decision process
commit process in github with reviews if needed.
domain manager(s) decide about content and inclusion/exclusion of git commiters
each domain is a github project

##builder approval

##fake products section
##product variation section

##product key
	why is it good?
		will allow vendors to simply join
		connection to vendor sites
	why is it bad?
		we play to the hands of makers & suppliers. Too many fake products aimed to confuse us...
		no good open database to start with
		best option - amazon ASIN. can we use it? will they dominate us?

	other options - ISBN, EAN, UPC
	anoter option - make-model-spec

##updated crowd content
  - wikipedia focus on old/checked content
  - news only on the latest - rearly formated

##penetration strategy - one domain or full
	one domain - laptops/mobile devices/computer games
		better content quality
		can assure quality to visitors
		learn
		amazon started with books
	multi domain
		better for investor confidence
	several main domains
		laptops/mobile devices/computer games 
		other domains with approval
